# The Great List of Stremio Addons

To see the great list of Stremio Addons go to [the website](https://stremio-addons.netlify.app/).

To submit a new addon to the list, use [this link](https://github.com/danamag/stremio-addons-list/issues/new?assignees=&labels=misc&template=submit-addon.yaml&title=Addon+Name).

To upvote / downvote an addon, find it in [the issues](https://github.com/danamag/stremio-addons-list/issues) and react with a thumbs up / down to the issue comment.

To comment on an addon, find it in [the issues](https://github.com/danamag/stremio-addons-list/issues) and comment on the issue, this will update the comments on the site too.


## How it works

When submitting an addon to the list, a github issue is created to represent this submission. If the original poster closes his/her issue, or someone with access to the project closes the issue, the addon will be removed from the list.

All addons in the list are ordered by the thumbs up / down votes of the github issues, if an addon has less than -10 votes it is removed from the list.

Commenting on an issue will also add the comments to the dedicated addon page on the website.


## Project Features

- anyone can publish an addon
- all addons are ordered by community votes, everyone can vote on addons
